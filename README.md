## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Mobile-First Authentication**: Secure, passwordless user login and signup using a phone number and OTP verification, powered by the Twilio Verify API.

    * For guest users, the cart is persisted in Local Storage.
    * For logged-in users, the cart is seamlessly synced with the database, making it available across devices and sessions.
* **Full E-commerce Flow**:
    * Browse a dynamic menu with real-time star ratings.
    * Add/remove/update items in the cart.
    * Complete checkout process with Razorpay integration (Test Mode).
    * View a detailed order history page.
    * "Repeat Order" functionality to quickly re-add items from a past purchase.
* **Interactive Review System**:
    * Users can only review items they have purchased.
    * Submit star ratings directly from the order history page.
    * Write detailed text comments in a pop-up modal.
    * Average ratings and review counts are displayed on the main menu.
    * Read detailed reviews in a popover on the menu page.
* **User Profile Management**:
    * Onboarding flow for new users to set their username.
    * "Edit Profile" modal to update username, email, and choose a custom avatar.
* **Performance Optimized**:
    * **Server-Side Rendering**: Key pages are rendered on the server for fast initial loads.
    * **React Suspense & Streaming**: Below-the-fold content is streamed in, preventing render-blocking and improving perceived performance.
    * **Lazy Loading**: All modals and non-critical components are lazy-loaded to reduce the initial JavaScript bundle size.
    * **Image Optimization**: All images are hosted on a CDN (Cloudinary) and served optimally using the Next.js `<Image>` component.

    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

    ```env
    # MongoDB
    MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"

    # NextAuth.js
    NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_super_secret_key_for_nextauth"

    # Twilio
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_twilio_account_sid"
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_twilio_auth_token"
    TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID="your_twilio_verify_service_sid"

    # Razorpay
    RAZORPAY_KEY_ID="your_razorpay_test_key_id"
    RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET="your_razorpay_test_key_secret"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID="your_razorpay_test_key_id" # This one is exposed to the client

    # Cloudinary (Optional, if you want to use your own images)
    CLOUDINARY_URL="cloudinary://api_key:api_secret@cloud_name"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üìù API Endpoints

## üìà Performance Optimizations Implemented

* **Server Components**: Most pages and components are rendered on the server to minimize client-side JavaScript and improve initial load times.
* **React Suspense & Streaming**: Below-the-fold content that requires data fetching (like the menu) is streamed to the browser, preventing it from blocking the rendering of critical, above-the-fold content.
* **Lazy Loading**: All modal dialogs (`AuthModal`, `EditProfileModal`, `ReviewModal`) are lazy-loaded using `next/dynamic` to ensure their code is only downloaded when needed.
* **Efficient API Design**: Created dedicated summary endpoints (e.g., `/api/reviews/summary`) that use database aggregation to perform complex calculations efficiently, reducing the number of required network requests.

---

## üìã Future Improvements

* **Mobile UI/UX**: Dedicated layouts and functionality for mobile devices.
* **Admin Dashboard**: A separate interface for managing users, orders, and menu items.
* **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for specific menu items.
* **Database Form Submissions**: Storing career and franchise form submissions in the database instead of sending emails.
